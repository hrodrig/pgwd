# .gitignore (whitelist)

- **Ignore everything by default**: The `.gitignore` excludes all files from the repo, including dotfiles (files and directories whose names start with `.`). No file or folder is tracked unless it is explicitly allowed.
- **Whitelist only**: Add exceptions (e.g. `!path/` or `!file`) only for what must be in the repository. Anything not listed as an exception stays ignored.
