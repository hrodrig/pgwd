# Release: tests must pass

Before creating a release (tag and `make release`):

- Run **`make test`** or **`go test ./...`** and ensure all tests pass.
- Fix any failing test before tagging or running `make release`.
- Do not push a release tag if the test suite is red.

Releases are made only from the `main` branch.
