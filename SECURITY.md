# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the **latest release** and the current development branch with security updates. We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest release (e.g. 0.2.x) | :white_check_mark: |
| Older releases | :x: |

When a vulnerability is fixed, we release a new patch version. Please upgrade to the latest release to receive security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue** for security vulnerabilities.

- **Preferred:** Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/hrodrig/pgwd/security/advisories/new) (click "Report a vulnerability") so the report is private.
- **Alternatively:** Email the maintainer (see profile at [github.com/hrodrig](https://github.com/hrodrig)) with a clear description, steps to reproduce, and impact.

**What to expect:**

- We will acknowledge your report as soon as possible.
- We will work on a fix and keep you updated. For critical issues we aim to release a patch promptly.
- If the report is accepted, we will credit you in the advisory or release notes (unless you prefer to stay anonymous).
- If the report is declined, we will explain why.

Thank you for helping keep pgwd and its users safe.
