# Contributing to pgwd

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

## How to contribute

- **Bug reports and feature requests:** Open an [issue](https://github.com/hrodrig/pgwd/issues) and use the template that fits best (bug report or feature request).
- **Code changes:** Open a pull request from a branch (e.g. `fix/description` or `feat/short-name`). We use the `develop` branch for integration; base your PR on `develop`.

## Code style

- Format Go code with `gofmt -s` (the `-s` simplify flag is used in our CI and by Go Report Card).
- Run tests before submitting: `go test ./...`
- Keep commits focused and messages clear.

## Questions

If you're unsure, open an issue with the "Question" label or describe your idea in a new issue so we can discuss it.
