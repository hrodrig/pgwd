# pgwd project rules

## .gitignore (whitelist)

- **Ignore everything by default**: The `.gitignore` excludes all files from the repo, including dotfiles (files and directories whose names start with `.`). No file or folder is tracked unless it is explicitly allowed.
- **Whitelist only**: Add exceptions (e.g. `!path/` or `!file`) only for what must be in the repository. Anything not listed as an exception stays ignored.

## Language

- **English only**: All project artifacts must be in English: code, comments, commit messages, docs, README, variable/function names, UI strings, and any other project content.

## Git flow (GitHub): develop → main and tagged releases

- **Branches**: Day-to-day work happens on `develop`. The `main` branch is production and must only be updated from `develop` (merge or squash) when the code is ready for release.
- **Releases**: Before publishing to GitHub or releasing a version:
  1. Ensure everything is committed on `develop` and tests pass.
  2. Merge `develop` into `main` (or open a Pull Request develop → main).
  3. On `main`, create an annotated tag with the version number (e.g. `v1.0.0`):  
     `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release 1.0.0"`  
     and push the tag:  
     `git push origin v1.0.0`
- **Versions**: Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for tags, e.g. `v1.2.3`.
- **Never** commit directly to `main` for features or fixes; everything must go through `develop`, then merge into `main` at release time.
